# Optimizing-Cancer-Rate-Prediction-with-Deep-Learning
This project applies deep learning techniques to classify cancer rates across countries using socio-economic and environmental factors. Through hyperparameter tuning and model optimization, various neural network architectures are evaluated to enhance prediction accuracy and provide actionable insights for public health.
